					<p>I’m Dash Skndash, a software engineer who cares about how systems behave beyond the happy path.</p>

					<p>
						I work across backend services and web applications, focusing on building software that is reliable, understandable, and
						production-ready. I value clear API design, solid data modeling, and code that remains maintainable as systems grow and
						requirements change.
					</p>

					<p>
						Lately, I’ve been spending more time learning about backend security, system design trade-offs, performance bottlenecks, and the
						kinds of failures that show up only in real production environments. I’m especially interested in understanding why systems
						break, not just how they work when everything goes right.
					</p>

					<p>
						My approach to engineering favors simplicity and explicitness over clever abstractions. I prefer designs that are easy to reason
						about, debug, and evolve incrementally, and I try to optimize for long-term maintainability rather than short-term wins.
					</p>

					<p>
						I build projects both to solve real problems and to explore ideas, usually by shipping early and iterating. This site is a place
						where I document that work, reflect on what I learn, and experiment in public.
					</p>

					<p>I’m currently based in India.</p>
